# Car_Parking_Detector
The aim of this project is to implement such a program based on image processing techniques which can help us to effectively track and monitor the car parking slots. We have used several image processing techniques like blurring, noise removal using median filtering, adaptive thresholding, and dilation etc. to complete our goal.
